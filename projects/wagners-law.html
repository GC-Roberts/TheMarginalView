    <h2>Abstract</h2>
    <p>
      This paper re-examines Wagner’s Law in a South African context over the period
      1960–2024. Wagner’s Law suggests that as real national income increases,
      government final consumption expenditure expands more than proportionally
      due to a higher income elasticity of demand for collective goods.
    </p>

    <p>
      Using annual data on real GDP and general government final consumption
      expenditure at constant 2015 prices, this study applies stationarity testing,
      autoregressive corrected estimation, and vector autoregression to assess both
      long-run elasticity and short-run causality. The findings contribute to the
      fiscal-growth literature in developing economies and inform South Africa’s
      fiscal policy challenges.
    </p>

    <h2>Introduction</h2>
    <p>
      The role of government in modern economies is extensive and multifaceted.
      Two dominant theoretical frameworks shape the debate on public expenditure
      and economic growth: Wagner’s Law and Keynesian theory.
    </p>

    <p>
      While Wagner’s Law posits that government spending rises disproportionately
      as income grows, Keynesian theory asserts that public expenditure can act as
      an exogenous driver of economic activity. South Africa’s fiscal trajectory
      since 1960 provides an ideal empirical setting to evaluate these competing
      perspectives.
    </p>

    <h2>Theoretical Framework and Literature</h2>
    <p>
      Wagner’s Law rests on three foundational assumptions: expanding legal and
      administrative functions, rising externalities from industrialization, and
      high income elasticity of demand for public goods. Collectively, these imply
      an increasing government share as economies develop.
    </p>

    <p>
      Empirical evidence remains mixed. While advanced economies often exhibit
      elasticity coefficients exceeding unity, developing economies display
      heterogeneous results due to institutional constraints and structural
      dynamics. For South Africa, prior studies report elasticity above one but
      ambiguous causality.
    </p>

    <h2>Data and Methodology</h2>
    <p>
      Annual observations from 1960–2024 on real GDP and government final
      consumption expenditure were obtained from the World Bank Development
      Indicators. Series were expressed in constant 2015 prices and transformed
      into natural logarithms.
    </p>

    <p>
      Stationarity was assessed using the Augmented Dickey–Fuller test. Given
      evidence of autocorrelation, elasticity was estimated using an AR(1)
      corrected GLS model. A bivariate VAR framework was employed to examine
      Granger causality between fiscal expenditure and output.
    </p>

    <h2>Results</h2>
    <p>
      The estimated elasticity coefficient of government expenditure with respect
      to GDP is approximately 1.20, indicating strong support for Wagner’s Law.
      This suggests that public expenditure in South Africa rises more than
      proportionally with income over the long run.
    </p>

    <p>
      Granger causality tests reveal that government expenditure significantly
      predicts future GDP, while GDP does not significantly predict government
      spending. This supports Keynesian dynamics in the short run, where fiscal
      policy acts as a catalyst for economic activity.
    </p>

    <h2>Policy Implications</h2>
    <p>
      Fiscal policy must balance long-term expenditure growth with short-term
      stabilization objectives. Strong elasticity implies that without corrective
      measures, government spending may outpace revenue growth.
    </p>

    <p>
      During economic downturns, targeted fiscal interventions and automatic
      stabilizers play a crucial role in mitigating demand shocks. However,
      expenditure growth must be carefully calibrated to preserve fiscal
      sustainability and avoid crowding out private investment.
    </p>

    <h2>Conclusion</h2>
    <p>
      This study provides empirical support for Wagner’s Law in South Africa while
      also validating Keynesian causality in the short run. The coexistence of
      these dynamics underscores the complexity of the fiscal-growth nexus and
      highlights the need for integrated and context-sensitive fiscal strategies.
